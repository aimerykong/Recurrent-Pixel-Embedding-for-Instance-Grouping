This is a demo for training instance segmentation using the proposed method. 
Please download the initial basemodel from the [google drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=15WHwfsNEV1I2cDxm9YGHSf_r2uHF1sQ-), and put the whole folder under directory "exp".
Once the initial model is ready, feel free to run the three script with name prefix "main00....m".
As the name suggests, "main000..." visualizes the results using the model specified inside the script; "main001_trainScript.m" provides a demo to train the model.
